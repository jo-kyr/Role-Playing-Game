# Introduction

# 1st Deliverable

#### Initial Settings
Following the instructions on the main page, I made a new fork of the Role Playing Game repository and activated GitHub Pages, so I can later publish my game there.

#### Getting Started
After setting up a new project in Unity, I started following the tutorial Ruby's Adventure. I made a new scene, imported my own character Neko and added basic motion through a script.

#### Character Controller and Keyboard Input
Next, following the tutorial, I altered the script so that the player can control Neko through the keyboard arrows.

#### World Design - Tilemaps
In order to built my own level, I searched on the Unity Asset Store for a tilemap set. I found one that I liked and added what I needed to my project.

Following along with the tutorial, I created two tilemaps; one for the walls and one for the grass. This helps layer the tiles the way I wanted. Lastly, I created another layer for the props, which I imported from the asset store.

#### Adjustments
Since the objects I imported had rigid body and collider components, I decided to add them to the walls and Neko as well. I kept testing the game and adjusting the physics, the order of the layers and the controller script accordingly.

Lastly, I added a camera that follows the player throught the level, and some background music.

#### Build, Run, Distribute
In order to share the game, I downloaded the WebGl platform and build the main scene. Next, I uploaded the Build, Template Data and index files to GitHub.
